What is Logistic Regression:
Is a type supervised learning where it used to solve classification problem.
E.g. When we have to predict if a student passes or fails in an exam when the number of hours spent studying is given as a feature, the response variable has two values, pass and fail.


Data set having labels like:
Yes-No, 0-1, etc. then use logistic regression as there linear regression fails.

Here we use Sigmoid function  
Y = 1/1+e-x 
x = independent variable (That has to be transformed) , e = 2.718 
e = natural logarithm base(also known as
Euler’s number).
Sigmoid function trying to convert the independent variable(feature) into a expression of Probability that ranges between 0-1 with respect to dependent variable.


Types of Logistic Regression:

1. Binomial Logistic Regression:
Based on the number of categories, Logistic regression can be classified as:
binomial: target variable can have only 2 possible types: “0” or “1” which may represent “win” vs “loss”, “pass” vs “fail”, “dead” vs “alive”, etc.


2. Multinomial Logistic Regression:
target variable can have 3 or more possible types which are not ordered(i.e. types have no quantitative significance) 
like “disease A” vs “disease B” vs “disease C”.


3. Ordinal Logistic Regression:
it deals with target variables with ordered categories. For example, a test score can be categorized as:“very poor”, “poor”, “good”,
“very good”. Here, each category can be given a score like 0, 1, 2, 3.
